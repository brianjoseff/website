<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Issue: Communicating true interest level via some sort of multi-parameter index. e.g., Time spent, works produced, information consumed, etc.</p>

- **Information Theory & Knowledge Organization**
    - …
- **Discovery, Philosophy of Science, & Adventure**
    - …
- **Neuroscience, Consciousness, Philosophy of Mind**
    - …
- **Natural World & Ecosystems**
    - Animal behavior. I believe someday we'll figure out how to commnicate directly with other organisms. It is perhaps my greatest wish to be able to converse with dolphins.
    - Conservation
    - Ecosystem modeling
- **Capitalism & Post-capitalism**
    - Inequality
    - Trend towards Surveillance-capitalism
    - System is producing sub-optimal outcomes given expressed human preferences. _e.g., Park City, UT residents want small-town community, unspoiled nature, and raw ski-culture. But what they get is endless development, traffic, disappearance of wilderness, and soul-less tourism_
    - Dealing with automation
- **Human Governance & Economics**
    - Post-neoliberal hegemonic projects
    - Ethics
    - Computational social science
    - Solving the Tragedy of the Commons, and other critical governance incentive-focused leverage points
    - Western liberalism as The Unwitting Silent Killer: Stability, homogeneity, stagnation, and death.
- **Unity, Cooperation, Harmony**
    - Game Theory
    - Tension between idealism and pragmatism
    - Hidden Order behind the ineffable beauty of harmonious things
- **Evolution**
    - Group-level selection
    - Altruism
    - Understanding the tension between Humanism, Egalitarianism, all that is good in us; and the seemingly unavoidable fact that threat responses dictate so much of our behavior. In other words, what is the way forward for humanity when you have a pack of rabid, insecure hooligans that are using biological-determinism/evolutionary-psychology to promulgate revanchist, chauvinist, violent, prejudiced views that are morally wrong and foolish, to boot, but not entirely false (unlike, say, Creationists vs. Scientific Establishment)
- **Physicality, Athletics, Conflict**
    - We are glorified primates: 
    - Soccer
- **Direct, Personal Compassion**
    - People’s personal stories of struggle, triumph, mundanity, etc.
    - Lyft: One of the few ways we can reliably break out of our social bubbles these days. I've met an incredibly diverse array of people in Lyft. I've documented some stories here. 
    - Diner counters: Another way to meet fascinating people, or non-fascinating people. I am an irrepressible harasser of counter-mates in dining establishments.

## Post-script: An exhortation to all free-thinking peoples

Please, in the name of all that you hold most dear, cherish the glowing ember of individuality smoldering within you. 

Hold it, coax it, breathe life into it regularly. Guard it from the deluge of mind-numbing, hope-drowning indignities and iniquities that the modern world rains down upon us. These anxious, drifting times feel endless, but they too shall pass.

We will rise from this soul-sucking muck, cast off these irons of banal evil and atavistic impulse and build a new world. A world where our inner lights can shine brightly. A world where we can open ourselves to the lights of others. A world where that primordial spark of kinship that as yet winks dimly behind all our eyes is allowed to burst forth and combine, fearlessly, with the sparks of our brothers and sisters around us to form a blazing fire of kinship whose warmth and light throws back the lurking shadowy evils of our past nature, and proudly radiates forth from Earth out into the unknown void, proclaiming our power, our love, and our hope.

We shall illuminate the darkness together.
