<h3>What is Strength in Diversity?</h3>
<p>We bring together people from different worlds to connect, learn from each other, and elevate each other.</p>

<p>Our core program is a mixed-income, mixed-race community of people living together in East Palo Alto, CA and helping each other make strides in creative careers.</p>

<h3>Why I built this</h3>
<p>Society is unequal. This inequality leads to hatred, violence, and loss of productivity. Unequal opportunity is also morally wrong. It is unfair.</p>

<p>Underprivileged people suffer from an <i>Opportunity Gap.</i></p>

<p>The secrets of the privileged world are unknown to them because the worlds of the “haves” and the “have-nots” do not overlap at all. Underprivileged people don’t even know what they are missing. To achieve success, health, and happiness--they must first gain exposure to these “unknown unknowns”.</p>

<p>Privileged people suffer from an <i>Empathy Gap.</i></p>

<p>They do not understand the hopes, needs, and fears of everyone else because they live in an isolated world of elites. This ignorance leads to violence, disunity, and short-sighted decision making. These ignorant people have control over all power in today’s world. This must change. To bring about peace, unity, and equality--they must first gain empathy.</p>
