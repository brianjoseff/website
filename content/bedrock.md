<h3>What is Bedrock?</h3>
<p>We are building a new type of digital machine.
Something powerful, private, and radically yours.
Designed from the ground up to protect, empower, and respect you.</p>

<h3>Why we are building this</h3>
<p>It's time for a Spaceship for the Mind.</p>
<p>“Bicycles for the mind” was a nice idea in 1979.</p>
<p>But we’ve now pedaled our way into darkness.</p>
<p>Those Bicycles have turned into corporate controlled exercise bikes that we pedal pedal furiously in some dark, meaningless rat race. Like a Black mirror episode.</p>

<p>Time for something new.</p>

<!-- 
<p>Our lives are being conducted increasingly online. This digital renaissance has led to some amazing things. Just imagine going back to a world without Google Maps. But it has also resulted in some surprisingly bad things. Like, threatening-the-continued-existence-of-our-species bad.</p>

<p>Our civic institutions, those hallowed, battle-tested pillars of society that we painstakingly built up from nothing and ferociously defended to the death time and again, are now being violently shook to their very foundations. The cracks are spreading rapidly and ominously, in a  way we haven’t seen before.</p>

<p>Our collective sanity is being assaulted by a constant barrage of toxic digital effluvium, a storm of enraged yet meaningless chatter howling in our ears, thousands of pings and pokes and messages and notifications and bills and requests and GoFundMes and hell.</p>

<p>Our self-hood is being hollowed out—identities hacked, money stolen, our free-will undermined by incredibly insidious manipulation, our humanity debased by automated indignity and overwhelming, incomprehensible demands from all corners.</p>

<p>This cannot go on.</p>

<p>We need a place to conduct our digital activities in peace.</p>

<p>Bedrock is that place.</p>
