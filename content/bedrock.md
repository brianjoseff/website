<h3>What is Bedrock?</h3>
<p>Private, personal supercomputers that organize everything for you while keeping your affairs totally hidden from everybody and everything.</p>

<h3>Why I built this</h3>
<p>Our lives are being conducted increasingly online. This digital renaissance has led to some amazing things. Just imagine going back to a world without Google Maps. But it has also resulted in some surprisingly bad things. Like, threatening-the-continued-existence-of-our-species bad.</p>

<p>Our civic institutions, those hallowed, battle-tested pillars of society that we painstakingly built up from nothing and ferociously defended to the death time and again, are now suddenly being violently shook to their very foundations. The cracks are spreading rapidly and ominously in a  way we haven’t seen before.</p>

<p>Our collective sanity is being assaulted by a constant barrage of toxic digital effluvium, a storm of enraged yet meaningless chatter howling in our ears, thousands of pings and pokes and messages and notifications and bills and requests and GoFundMes and hell.</p>

<p>Our self-hood is being hollowed out—identities hacked, money stolen, our free-will undermined by incredibly insidious manipulation, our humanity debased by automated indignity and overwhelming, incomprehensible demands from all corners.</p>

<p>This cannot go on.</p>

<p>We need a place to conduct our digital activities in peace.</p>

<p>Bedrock is that place.</p>
