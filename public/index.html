    <p class="hero-bio">I want to see everyone win.</p>
    <p>Not just because it pains me to see people suffer (which it does because I love you guys ❤️). But also because I’m a pragmatist.</p>
    <p>The inequality and "soft oppression" engendered by late 20th-century neoliberal capitalism is the biggest waste ever. Waste in that we are squandering mind-boggling amounts of human capital by consigning 90% of our sisters and brothers to the dustbin of societal irrelevance the second they pop out of the womb.</p>

    <p>We may have many freedoms on paper, particular in western democracies like the good old US of A. But these freedoms mean nothing when we are too ignorant, insecure, and unhealthy to make use of them. These freedoms mean nothing when in the true balance of power they’re like a fart in the wind. Powerless. <span style="font-style: italic; color: #999999; ">Fortune 500 companies can hire legions of lobbyists to bend the machinery of governance to their will...you get to go wait in line at the fire station every two years to vote for blubbering self-promoting narcissists who do nothing for you. QED.</span></p>
 
    <p>True flourishing stems from not just having freedoms but being able to fully utilize those freedoms.</p>

    <p>This means having access to education that equips us to wisely use our freedom of speech. Being healthy so we can actually show up as engaged citizens. Being secure so that we can calmly navigate the rollercoaster of emotion that is natural for any group of diverse people working hard on big things.</p>

    <p>It means living in a society where our views and needs actually mean something. Where we aren't just doormats for the 1% nor pawns in the power-games of selfish megalomaniac assholes nor cannon-fodder for the mindless profiteering of massive world-destroying companies. Where, instead, we are given a real chance to be the best we can be.</p>

    <p>Sure, humans are certainly capable of doing jaw-droppingly stupid and evil stuff. But I believe our better angels will ultimately prevail. We just need to give ourselves the space and support to get there.</p>

    <p>My work is devoted to making this vision of a more happy, healthy, and just world a reality.</p>

    <p>Currently I am building <a href="/bedrock" class="link">Bedrock</a>, a technology that helps people manage their digital life while respecting their freedom and humanity. <span style="font-style: italic; color: #999999; ">In other words--Google/FB/NSA/et al -- back off and let us do our thing in peace.</span></p>

    <p>I love reading and soccer, physicality and art, petrichor in the chaparral covered hills of Santa Barbara with the sun spangled waters of the SB channel glittering in the distance. I love animals and trees, bleak windswept vistas and the primordial mist-shrouded coasts of Northern California.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to seeing you out there.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Issue: Communicating true interest level via some sort of multi-parameter index. e.g., Time spent, works produced, information consumed, etc.</p>

- **Information Theory & Knowledge Organization**
    - …
- **Discovery, Philosophy of Science, & Adventure**
    - …
- **Neuroscience, Consciousness, Philosophy of Mind**
    - …
- **Natural World & Ecosystems**
    - Animal behavior. I believe someday we'll figure out how to commnicate directly with other organisms. It is perhaps my greatest wish to be able to converse with dolphins.
    - Conservation
    - Ecosystem modeling
- **Capitalism & Post-capitalism**
    - Inequality
    - Trend towards Surveillance-capitalism
    - System is producing sub-optimal outcomes given expressed human preferences. _e.g., Park City, UT residents want small-town community, unspoiled nature, and raw ski-culture. But what they get is endless development, traffic, disappearance of wilderness, and soul-less tourism_
    - Dealing with automation
- **Human Governance & Economics**
    - Post-neoliberal hegemonic projects
    - Ethics
    - Computational social science
    - Solving the Tragedy of the Commons, and other critical governance incentive-focused leverage points
    - Western liberalism as The Unwitting Silent Killer: Stability, homogeneity, stagnation, and death.
- **Unity, Cooperation, Harmony**
    - Game Theory
    - Tension between idealism and pragmatism
    - Hidden Order behind the ineffable beauty of harmonious things
- **Evolution**
    - Group-level selection
    - Altruism
    - Understanding the tension between Humanism, Egalitarianism, all that is good in us; and the seemingly unavoidable fact that threat responses dictate so much of our behavior. In other words, what is the way forward for humanity when you have a pack of rabid, insecure hooligans that are using biological-determinism/evolutionary-psychology to promulgate revanchist, chauvinist, violent, prejudiced views that are morally wrong and foolish, to boot, but not entirely false (unlike, say, Creationists vs. Scientific Establishment)
- **Physicality, Athletics, Conflict**
    - We are glorified primates: 
    - Soccer
- **Direct, Personal Compassion**
    - People’s personal stories of struggle, triumph, mundanity, etc.
    - Lyft: One of the few ways we can reliably break out of our social bubbles these days. I've met an incredibly diverse array of people in Lyft. I've documented some stories here. 
    - Diner counters: Another way to meet fascinating people, or non-fascinating people. I am an irrepressible harasser of counter-mates in dining establishments.

<h2 id="post-script-an-exhortation-to-all-free-thinking-peoples">Post-script: An exhortation to all free-thinking peoples</h2>

<p>Please, in the name of all that you hold most dear, cherish the glowing ember of individuality smoldering within you.</p>

<p>Hold it, coax it, breathe life into it regularly. Guard it from the deluge of mind-numbing, hope-drowning indignities and iniquities that the modern world rains down upon us. These anxious, drifting times feel endless, but they too shall pass.</p>

<p>We will rise from this soul-sucking muck, cast off these irons of banal evil and atavistic impulse and build a new world. A world where our inner lights can shine brightly. A world where we can open ourselves to the lights of others. A world where that primordial spark of kinship that as yet winks dimly behind all our eyes is allowed to burst forth and combine, fearlessly, with the sparks of our brothers and sisters around us to form a blazing fire of kinship whose warmth and light throws back the lurking shadowy evils of our past nature, and proudly radiates forth from Earth out into the unknown void, proclaiming our power, our love, and our hope.</p>

<p>We shall illuminate the darkness together.</p>
